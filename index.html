<h1> Welcome to Freera1n.net! </h1>

We are just a group of friends hosting our own servers, having fun with some of the more interesting and a little more advanced side of games. We want to see how games work on the server side and have fun making our own modifications to game server. Right now we host Minecraft and Terraria, but are slowly adding more stuff for fun. We have a private discord server for us to talk on and share our experiences through voice and chat. We play on the servers we make for longer periods of time. Some of the players stream from them too. 

Current filming/streamers on our server,
